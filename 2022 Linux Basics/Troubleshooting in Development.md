# Troubleshooting in Development

**Real world problems**

The application I developed is working on my laptop. But it breaks when run on company server. Why...?

- Network?
- Permission issue? 

<br>

Possible reasons

- `Code`: it's working on my laptop. So rule it out.
- `development environment`: break down to working vs breaking environments.
  - `network`
    - check the connectivity between the app and the DB server.
    - are the ports open?
    - run a telnet check.
  - `access permission`
    - check which user and user permissions.
  - `environmental dependencies`:
  - `configuration issues`:
